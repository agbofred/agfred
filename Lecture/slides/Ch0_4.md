## Announcements
- Homework
	- Problem Set 1 due on Friday night!
- You should have met with your section!
    - If you missed it, reach out to your section leader, and set yourself a reminder for next week
    - I may be approaching a few of you in the coming days to see if you'd be willing to swap to another to help keep the numbers balanced
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net/)

## Review Question
::::::cols
::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.5'}
Karel starts as shown to the right. At which beeper do they end up when the below sequence of commands finishes?

```python
while no_beepers_present():
	while front_is_clear():
		move()
		if beepers_present():
			turn_left()
        else:
            turn_right()
	turn_left()
```

## Counting Loops
- Sometimes we **know** the number of times we want to loop
	- It is not dependent on some condition like a while loop
- In these circumstances, the iterative statement called a _for_ loop is best used
- Syntax looks like:

	```python
	for i in range(desired_count):
		# statements to be repeated
	```
   - `desired_count` is an _integer_ indicating the number of times you want the loop to repeat
   - The `i` is a name that we will later make more general, but for now you can always leave it as an `i`


## An Example `for` you 
::::::cols
::::col
- Suppose Karel starts in the bottom left corner of a "room"
- We want Karel to create a 6x6 square outline of beepers in the center of the room
- Need to repeat making each side 4 times
- Need to repeat placing a beeper and moving 6 times for each side
	- Placing 6 beepers requires moving only 5 times. So not everything can be in the loop
::::
::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{10}{10}
\foreach \x in {3,4,5,6,7,8}{
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{\x}{3};
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{\x}{8};
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{3}{\x};
	\karelbeeper[MBlue]{8}{\x};
}

## A Potential Solution
```{.python style="max-height: 900px"}
import karel

def main():
    """Draw a 4x4 square in the world."""
    position()
    draw_box()

def position():
    """Move to starting corner of box."""
    move()
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    move()
    turn_right()

def turn_right():
    """Turns Karel 90 deg to the right."""
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def draw_box():
    """Draws a box with 4 equal sides in a CCW direction."""
    for i in range(4):
        draw_6_line()
        turn_left()

def draw_6_line():
    """Draws a straight line of 6 beepers, if space."""
    for i in range(5):
        if no_beepers_present():
            put_beeper()
        if front_is_clear():
            move()
    if no_beepers_present(): # Last beeper to make 6
        put_beeper()
```

-->

## Summary So Far
::::::{.cols style='font-size:.95em'}
::::col
:::{.block name="Karel Cmds"}
- Karel can only:
	- `move()`
	- `turn_left()`
	- `pick_beeper()`
	- `put_beeper()`
- Get info about surroundings using predicate functions
	- Eg. `front_is_clear()`
	- Inverse options exist as well
:::

:::{.block name="Functions"}
- Group code into reusable bundles
```python
def function_name():
	# Code to be grouped
```
:::
::::

::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.5'}
:::{.block name="Control Statements"}
- Conditional statements
	- Run certain code blocks only if a condition is true (the `else` block is optional)
	```python
	if condition_test:
		# Code if answer yes
	else:
		# Code if answer no
	```
- Iterative statements
	- Repeat code block as long as condition is true
	```python
	while condition_test:
		# Code to repeat
	```
	- Repeat set number of times
	```python
	for i in range(desired_count):
		# Code to repeat
	```

## Stepwise Refinement {.data-auto-animate}
::::::cols
::::col
- The most successful way to solve a complex problem is to break it down into progressively simpler problems
- Begin by breaking the whole problem into a few simpler parts
    - Some of these parts might then need further breaking down into even simpler parts
- The process is commonly called _stepwise refinement_ or _decomposition_

## Excellent Decomposing
- A good problem decomposition should mean:

  The proposed pieces should be easy to explain
    : One indication that you have succeeded is if it is easy to give them simple names

  The steps are as general as possible
    : Each piece of code you can reuse is one less piece of code you need to write! If your steps solve general tasks, they are much easier to reuse.

  The steps should make logical sense for the problem you are solving
    : If you have a function that will work to solve a step but was designed (and named) with something else entirely in mind, adopt it for the currently needed situation

## Enter the Winter
- Suppose we want Karel to usher in the Fall/Winter by removing the "leaves" from the tops of all the trees

## Algorithms
- The process of designing a solution strategy to a problem is called _algorithmic design_
- An _algorithm_ is just an approach or recipe for a method to solve a particular problem
	- Frequently language agnostic
- Algorithms are not a new concept
	- Euclid's algorithm to find greatest common denominators for instance
- A large part of computer science is focused on the study or analysis of algorithms

## Algorithm ⮕ Code
- You need to have an algorithm in place **before** you can write the code to tell the computer what you want to do
	- Imagine an alien asking me how to bake a cake. I need to understand the steps to baking the cake before I can even worry about the translation or communication
- Programming tools like conditional statements and loops will frequently play a role in your algorithm, but as general concepts
	- I can easily describe a loop to you without needing the exact syntax of Python
- The implementation of the algorithm is the act of translating it into Python (or whatever language you are using)

## An Amazing Algorithm
::::::cols
::::{.col style='font-size:.9em'}
- Consider a simple, loop-less, maze that we want to move through
    - Karel could start anywhere
    - The end of the maze is a beeper
- A common algorithm to get through the maze is to essentially always follow or touch the wall to your right
    - How could we phrase this in language Karel would understand?
- Let's take the rest of class to work with a neighbor(s) to sketch out your code
    - Want to test it? A zip with some mazes is located [here]()

## Data Types
- Generally, the data processed by computers can take on many forms
- A _data type_ defines the common characteristics of some data values that have a certain form or purpose.
	- Ex: a whole number or integer has certain characteristics common to all integers
- A data type has a _domain_, which is the set of all potential values that would belong to that type.
	- Ex: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...
- A data type has a _set of operations_ that define how those values can be manipulated
	- Ex: You can add two whole numbers (5+2)

## Numeric Types
- Initially, we'll focus on the numeric types
- Python has 3 data types for representing numbers:
	- `int`{.python} for integers and whole numbers

		```python
		1, 2, 3, 10, 1001010101, -231
		```

	- `float`{.python} for numbers containing a decimal point

		```python
		1.23, 3.14, 10.001, 0.0, -8.23
		```

	- `complex`{.python} for numbers with an imaginary component (which we won't deal with)

---

## Expressions
- Python describes computation using _arithmetic expressions_, which consist of _terms_ joined by _operators_
	- Very similar to how a logical English sentence has nouns connected by verbs
- A term in an expression can be:
	- an explicit numeric value (called a literal) like 1 or 3.14
	- a variable name serving as a placeholder to a value (more on those in a moment!)
	- a value resulting from the output of a function call (more on those on Monday!)
	- another expression enclosed in parentheses

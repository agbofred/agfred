## Motivations
:::incremental
- The field of computing today is scarcely recognizable compared to the field 50 years ago.
- Many feel the pace of the field is only accelerating as we move forwards.
- Studying computing now lets you take part in driving forward not only the field of computing, but of all the modern fields with utilize computing.
	- Almost all fields!
:::

:::notes
Discuss my own motivations as well!

## How to Succeed
- People enter this course with a variety of initial experiences
	- This course is built for an individual entering with **zero** coding experience
- Path to Success
	- There is a significant time committment for this course
		- The only way to get good at coding is to **do** coding
		- Coding can often times involve a lot of frustrating troubleshooting or failed attempts
		- Expect, on average, the full use of WU's 2-3 hours outside class for every hour in class
	- If you are stuck for more than 30 minutes, _ask myself or your section leader for help_
		- While it is important to give yourself time to troubleshoot, when you are learning, past a certain point just leads to frustration


## Squad Goals
::: {.block name="Primary Objective"}
To gain the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary to write, test, and debug Python programs requiring several hundred lines of code.
:::

Doing so will require that students be able to:

- implement simple algorithms using Python control structures,
- apply decomposition and step-wise refinement techniques,
- design data structures to model information,
- execute all phases of the programming process, including design, implementation, testing and debugging,


## Grading
::::cols
:::col
- Standard 90/80/70 etc grade cut-offs
	- Top 2% get +'s, bottom 2% get -'s
:::

## Participation
- Scored through participation in class polls or in contacting me with a question about a specific slide.
- Generally 1-2 polls per day
- Answering any poll gets you full points for the day (even if you are wrong!)
- Answering correctly gets you bits of extra credit
- Polling website at [http://rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)
- Will start officially on Friday

---

## Homework
- Falls into two categories:
	- _Problem Sets:_ smaller, more focused assignments
		- Graded on standard, numeric scales
	- _Projects:_ larger, more integrative assignments
		- Graded on a more qualitative scale (next slide)
- All will be due on Fridays at 11:59pm
- Submissions of _both_ will be handled through Github Classroom
	- Learning how to do this in class
- 3 cumulative late days over the entire semester without penalty then penalties enacted for each subsequent day late
- Extensions for any reason need to be requested and approved by myself

## Project Scoring

------ -----------------
     A submission so good it "makes me weep"
      Exceeds requirements
     Satisfies all assignment requirements
      Meets most requirements, but some issues
     Some more serious problems evident
      Even worse...
     Why even bother turning this in?
------ -----------------


## Sections
- Everyone will be placed into small sections of 8-10 students, with one section leader
- All section leaders are students who recently took and excelled in this course
- Will meet as a group with your section leader once a week for an hour to go over and work on problems
	- These meetings will be on Mondays or Tuesdays
	- Poll out **today** where you can enter in your availability on these days so that we can get people placed into sections
- Section leaders will also serve as a secondary source you can ask for help or guidance from throughout the week
	- This tutoring is part of their job! Don't hesitate to ask them for some extra assistance!
- Planning to start section meetings _next_ week


## Tests
- Tests are necessary to assure retention of material and ensure that some are not getting too much help on the assignments.
- Just two this semester:
	- Midterm on March 3
	- Final on May 12
- Tests will be taken in class and will not allow the use of a computer
	- This policy has actually been seen to _improve_ student scores, as it prevents you from wasting tons of time obsessing about a small mistake!
- Tests _will_ be open note
- Example tests and study materials will be given out a week in advance.


## Communication
- I tend to find WISE lacking both from a polish perspective and from an ease of use perspective
- I have had much better luck recently channeling class communication (announcements, questions, answers, etc) through a class Discord server
	- Invite instructions are posted on the main WISE class landing page
	- Totally free to sign up and use
	- If you already use Discord, you _can_ create another account to switch between, or you can use your existing account
- Will be the main online location for announcements and questions and answers.
- Has support for code-blocks when talking about code by surrounding code in triple backticks: ` ```this is formatted nicely as code``` `{.text}


## Academic Honesty
1. You must not look at solutions or program code that is not your own.
2.  You must not share your solution code with other students.
    - But you are welcome (and encouraged!) to work alongside others enroute to finding a solution.
3. You must indicate on your submitted assignment any assistance you received or who you worked alongside.



## Diving In
::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
- This course is an introduction on _computer science_, and covers more than just programming!
- Python is used to teach the programming portion of the course, but the focus is less on Python itself and more on general computer science principles.
- If you come across situations where you need to know a bit more about specific Python details, there are plenty of resources online, or just ask me!

## Effective Communication
::: incremental
- To communicate effectively with someone or something, you really need two layers of communication:
	- A shared language or method of conveying information 
		- The English alphabet, for example
		- In our case, Python
	- A joint agreement about what constitutes **meaning**
		- Need ways to limit confusion or misunderstanding
			- Following conventions
		- Being able to explain things clearly and unambiguously
:::

## Giving Clear Instructions
- We will initially make the language _extremely_ simple so that we can focus on the second layer
- Karel the Robot exists in a very simple 2D world
- Has a very limited set of actions:
	- Can move forward one space
	- Can rotate counter-clockwise (turn left) 90 degrees
	- Can pick up a beeper
	- Can drop off a beeper
- We will be spending the first several class days just interested in how we can take these simple instructions and get Karel to solve a wide variety of problems
	- This content is not in your book, but more in-depth descriptions can be found [here](https://willamette.edu/~esroberts/pykarel/reader/01-IntroducingKarel.html)

## The World
::::::cols
::::col
- Karel's world is defined on a grid
	- _avenues_ run north-south
	- _streets_ run east-west
	- The _intersection_ between a street and avenue is called a corner
- Compass directions are as you'd have them on a map, with North pointing upwards
- Walls are impassable
- Beepers are diamonds
- Karel is a house-shaped polygon
::::

::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{3}{3}
\draw[MGreen, very thick] (3.5,2.5) --+(-1,0);
\karelbeeper[MBlue]{3}{1}
\karelmark[MYellow]{2}{3}{90}
\end{tikzpicture}

::::
::::::

## Commands
- As we mentioned before, Karel is a simple robot, and can really only do 4 potential actions

	 Command | Action
	:----|:--------
	`move()` | Moves Karel forward one corner in whatever direction they are facing
	`turn_left()` | Rotates Karel 90 deg counter-clockwise
	`pick_beeper()` | Picks up a beeper on the ground
	`put_beeper()` | Places a beeper on the ground

- Our commands are just sequences of these actions

## Example
::::::cols
::::col
- Suppose we had the situation to the right and wanted to navigate to the beeper, pick it up, and then drop it at the corner of 1st avenue and 1st street.
- Take a moment to write out your instructions.
	- Remember you can only move, rotate left, and pick up or drop the beeper
- Note that there are multiple ways to do this! Which is better?
::::

::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{3}{3}

\draw[MGreen, very thick] (3.5,2.5) --+(-1,0) (0.5,1.5) --+ (2,0);
\karelbeeper[MBlue]{3}{1}
\karelmark[MYellow]{1}{3}{0}

\end{tikzpicture}

```{.python style='max-height:800px'}
def main():
	move()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	turn_left()

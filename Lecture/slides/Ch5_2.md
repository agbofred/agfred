## New Methods
:::{style='font-size:.9em'}
- A new method that acts on a `GWindow`:

 |
:---|:----
`get_element_at(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns the frontmost object at (x,y) or `None`

- And more new methods that act on any `GObject`

 | 
:---|:---------
`set_location(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Resets the location of the object to the specified point
`move(dx,dy)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dx` and `dy` pixels from its current position
`move_polar(dr,theta)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dr` pixel units in direction `theta`
`contains(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns `True` if the object contains the specified point
`get_color()`{.no-highlight} | Returns the color currently assigned to the object

## The Python Event Model
- Graphical applications usually make it possible for the user to control the action of a program by using an input device such a mouse.
	- Programs supporting this type of control are called _interactive programs_.
- User actions such as clicking the mouse are called _events_.
- Programs that respond to events are said to be _event driven_.
- User input does not generally occur at predictable times. As the events are not controlled by the program, they are said to be _asynchronous_.
- In Python, you write a function that acts as a _listener_ for a particular event type. When the event happens, the listener is called.


## First Class Functions
- Functions in Python are treated as data values just like anything else!
	- We will need to take advantage of this to write listener functions.
- You can assign a function to a variable, pass it as a parameter, return it as a result, etc
- Functions treated like any other data value are called _first-class functions_
- To work with a function itself, you leave off the `()`. Including the parentheses is how you _call_ the function!



## A First Class Example
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
import math

def evaluate_numbers(func):
	print(func)
	print(func(0))
	print(func(2))
	print(func(10))

A = evaluate_numbers

A(math.sqrt)
A(math.exp)
```


## Closures

Consider the code to the right. 

::::: incremental
- Why does the line 12 not error?
    - Nothing named `a` should still exist when it is called!

- `f2` must also keep track of any local variables!
- The local variables that are included as part of a function are called its _closure_
:::::

:::
:::col
```{.python style='max-height:800px' data-line-numbers=''}
b = 1
def f1(a):
    print(a)
	print(b)

	def f2():
		c = a + b
		return c * 3
	return f2 

f2 = f1(10) 
c = f2()
```

## Our First Interactive Example
:::{style='font-size:.9em'}
- Consider the simple program below, where we've imported the basics and some of our helper functions
  ```python
  def draw_dots():
      def click_action(event):
          c = create_filled_rect(
              event.get_x(), event.get_y(), 
              10,10, random_color())
          gw.add(c)
  
      gw = GWindow(500, 500)
      gw.add_event_listener("click", click_action)
  ```
- The `click_action` function specifies what to do when the mouse is clicked
	- Note that it has access to the `gw` variable since it is in the enclosing function and thus in the closure.
:::

## Registering a Listener
- The last line of our example function:

	```python
	gw.add_event_listener("click", click_action)
	```
	tells the graphics window (`gw`) to call the `click_action` function whenever a mouse "click" occurs within the window.
- When the user clicks the mouse, the graphics window, in essense, calls the client back to let them know that a click has occured. Thus, functions such as `click_action` are known as _callback functions_.
- The parameter `event` given to the callback function is a special data structure called a _mouse event_, which contains details about the specifics of the event that triggered the action.


## Mouse Events
- We have a fairly comprehensive list of mouse-events that we can trigger callbacks on:

| Name | Description
---:|:-----
`"click"` | The user clicks the mouse in the window
`"dblclk"` | The user double-clicks the mouse in the window
`"mousedown"` | The user presses the mouse button down
`"mouseup"` | The user releases the mouse button
`"mousemove"` | The user moves the mouse
`"drag"` | The user moves the mouse with the button down


## Event Details
- Certain actions can trigger more than one event
	- Clicking generates a "mousedown", "mouseup", and then "click" event, in that order
- Events trigger no action unless the window is listening for that event
	- If I drag my mouse in the `draw_dots()` function, you'll notice that nothing happens
- You can setup however many listeners you feel you need in order to make your program behave as desired
```python
gw.add_event_listener("click", click_action)
gw.add_event_listener("dblclk", dblclk_action)
```

## Line Drawing
- Say we wanted to write a simple program that allows the user to draw lines by clicking and dragging the mouse
- Using two event listeners would be useful:
	- "mousedown" could start drawing a zero-length line at the current mouse position (and add it to the window)
	- "drag" could update the end-point of that line
- The strategy would allow the user to have visual feedback as they drag around, helping them to position the line
	- Since the line stretches and contracts as you move the cursor around, the technique is commonly called _rubber-banding_

## Attempt #1
```{.python .badcode style="max-height:800px;"}
from pgl import GWindow, GLine

WIDTH = 500
HEIGHT = 500

def draw_lines():
	def mousedown_event(e):
		x = e.get_x()
		y = e.get_y()
		line = GLine(x,y,x,y)
		gw.add(line)

	def drag_action(e):
		line.set_end_point(e.get_x(), e.get_y())

	gw = GWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
	line = None
	gw.add_event_listener("mousedown", mousedown_event)
	gw.add_event_listener("drag", drag_action)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	draw_lines()
```

## What Happened?
- Remember that if you define a variable in a function, that variable is assumed to be local!
	- Keeps you from accidentally overwriting variables you may not have meant to
	- It works against us here, since we WANT to override the original value
- We can't pass in the info as a parameter, since it is not part of the event information
- Python _does_ have a `nonlocal` keyword, which allows you to state that a specific variable is _not_ local, but it tends to just confuse students


## In the Window
- A common tactic is to store all variables that need to be shared between two or more functions in a _state object_
- A state object is just a single object which serves as a storage space for a collection of values
- The object is created in such a location as to ensure it is in the closure of any functions that need to access its contents
- We will most often encounter this issue with graphics applications, where we actually already have an object that could serve as a state object
    - The `GWindow` object (mostly commonly named `gw`)!


## Storage and Retrieval
- Do you want to store a value in your state object?
    - We can store it as an _attribute_ to the `gw` object
    - Requires specifying the object name, followed by a dot and then your desired attribute name:
    
    ```python
    gw.my_attribute_name = some_cool_value
    ```
- Do you want to retrieve a value from your state object?
    - Just refer to the object and attribute name:
      
      ```python
      print(gw.my_attribute_name)
      ```



<!--
## Using `GState`
- The PGL library has a `GState` object type that we can import to use for sharing data between callback functions
- Create a variable, conventionally called `gs` immediately after creating the window:
```python
gw = GWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
gs = GState()
```
- Value to be shared can be stored as part of the `gs` variable as an object attribute, which we will talk much more about in Ch 9
	- For now, shared variables should include `gs` and then a period before the variable name.
	- So `line` will become `gs.line` everywhere in our example
-->

## Fixed Line-Drawing
```{.python style="max-height:800px;"}
from pgl import GWindow, GLine

WIDTH = 500
HEIGHT = 500

def draw_lines():
	def mousedown_event(e):
		x = e.get_x()
		y = e.get_y()
		gw.line = GLine(x,y,x,y)
		gw.add(gw.line)

	def drag_action(e):
		gw.line.set_end_point(e.get_x(), e.get_y())

	gw = GWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
	gw.line = None
	gw.add_event_listener("mousedown", mousedown_event)
	gw.add_event_listener("drag", drag_action)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	draw_lines()
```


## Timer Events
- Previously we looked at how our programs could react to mouse events
- Can also listen for _timer events_, which occur after a specific time interval
- You specify the listener for a timer event in the form of a callback function that is invoked at the end of the time interval
- Can add animation to our graphics by creating a timer whose callback makes small updates to the graphical objects in the window
	- If the time interval is short enough (usually sub 30 milliseconds), the animations will appear smooth to the human eye


## Timer Types
- PGL supports two kinds of timers:
	- A _one-shot timer_ invokes its callback **only once** after a specified delay
		- Created with

		  ```python
		  gw.set_timeout(function, delay)
		  ```
		  where `function` is the callback function and `delay` is the time interval in milliseconds
	- An _interval timer_ invokes its callback function **repeatedly** at regular intervals
		- Created with

			```python
			gw.set_interval(function, delay)
			```
- Both methods return a `GTimer` object that identifies the timer, and can be stopped by invoking the `.stop()` method on that timer


## Moving Square
```{.python style="max-height:900px"}
def moving_square():
    def step():
		square.move(dx, dy)
		if square.get_x() > 500:
			timer.stop()

	gw = GWindow(500, 200)
	dx = 1
	dy = 0
	square = create_filled_rect(12, 100, 24, 24, "red")
	gw.add(square)
	timer = gw.set_interval(step, 20)
```

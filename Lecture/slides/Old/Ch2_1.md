## Review Question
What is the final printed value in the code below?

:::: cols
::: col
:::::{.poll}
#. `True`
#. `False`
#. `"4Quiz"`
#. This would give an error
:::::
:::

::: {.col style="flex-grow:2;"}
```python
A = 10
B = 4
C = "Quiz"
A *= len(C)
if A > 40 and C != "C":
	print(str(B)+C)
else:
	print(A < B or not C == "C")

```

## Controlling Functions
 - The body of a function can contain statements of any type, including control statements
 - Example:
 	
	```python
	def max(x, y):
		if x > y:
			return x
		else:
			return y
	```
- `return` statements can be used anywhere and may appear more than once
	- The function terminates as soon as it hits a `return` statement though!


## Getting Lost
- In a broad sense, how could we implement the following with logical if statements?

![Lost Woods](../images/lost_woods.gif){width=60%}


## Best Effort
```{.python style="max-height:800px"}
if < move right >:
	< background = lost woods >
	if < move right >:
		< background = lost woods >
		if < move right >:
			< background = lost woods >
			...
		else:
			< background = exit >
	else:
		< background = exit >
else:
	< background = exit >

```

	\draw[ultra thick, -latex, Red] (t.north) |- ($(c2.west)+(-.5,1.5)$) |- (c2.west);

## It can take a `while`
- The `while` statement is the simplest of Python's iterative control statements and has the following form:

	```python
	while < condition >:
		< statements to be repeated >
	```
- Upon encountering the `while` statement, Python evaluates the condition
- If condition is true, the statements in the body are executed
- After the last body statement executed, Python again checks the condition. If still true, the body statements run again

<!--It is very possible to accidentally write infinite loops with `while` loops! If you find this has happened, you can press Ctl + C in the console to break out of it.-->

## An Example Walkthrough
```{.python data-line-numbers="1-9|1|9|1|2|3|4|5|6|3|4|5|6|3|4|5|6|3|7|9"}
def digit_sum(n):
	total = 0
	while n > 0:
		value = n % 10
		total += value
		n //= 10
	return total

print(digit_sum(123))
```


## Sentinels
- Many programs in programming can be approched similarly by using a particular _idiom_ or _pattern_
- A common one with repetition is to use a variable to keep track of the loop state until something particular happens (the sentinel is triggered)
<br><br>

```python
finished = False
while not finished:
	line = input("Enter a number: ")
	if line == "":
		finished = True
	else:
		print(line)
```

## Lost Woods Example
```{.python style='max-height:800px'}
dir = 'W'
onpath = 0
atEnd = False
while not atEnd:
    print('')
    print('*'*10 + '     ' + '*'*10)
    print('*'*10 + '     ' + '*'*10)
    print(' '*10 + ' :) ' + ' '*10)
    print('*'*10 + '     ' + '*'*10)
    print('*'*10 + '     ' + '*'*10)
    dir = input('Go (N)orth, (S)outh, (E)ast, or (W)est? ')

    if dir == 'N' and onpath == 0:
        onpath = 1
    elif dir == 'W' and onpath == 1:
        onpath = 2
    elif dir == 'S' and onpath == 2:
        onpath = 3
    elif dir == 'W' and onpath == 3:
        atEnd = True
    else:
        onpath = 0

print('You escaped!')
```


## Understanding Check

What will the printed output of the code to the left?

## Iterating over sequences
- It comes up often that we iterate over some sequence or range

	```python
	i = 0
	while i < 10:
		print(i)
		i += 1
	```
- Python provides us with a special type of loop exactly for these types of operations!
- Called a **for** loop
	- Can think of it as saying: "_For_ each thing in this sequence, run this code"

## For Loop Anatomy
- `for` loops have a simple syntax:

	```python
	for < variable > in < sequence >:
		< loop code >
	```
- `< loop code >` is no different from what we were already doing in the body of `while` loops
- `< variable >` is a variable name that will be assigned every value in the sequence over the course of the loop
- `< sequence >` is any expression that produces a variable that supports iteration


## The `range()` iterable
- Need an easy way to produce or describe a range of numeric values
- The built-in `range()` function handles this and produces the needed iterable object
- Takes 1, 2, or 3 arguments:
	- Start (default 0): where to start the sequence at
	- Stop (mandatory): the sequence ends just _below_ this value (does not include it!)
	- Step (default 1): what value the sequence counts by
<br><br>

:::{.block name='Warning!'}
Be careful, the `range` function will stop one step _before_ the final stop value.
:::


## For ranging examples
- Providing just a stop argument:

	```python
	for n in range(5):
		print(n)
	```
- Providing a start and stop:

	```python
	for n in range(1,11):
		print(n)
	```
- Providing a start, stop, and step:

	```python
	for n in range(10,0,-1):
		print(n)
	```


## Iterating over sequences
- We can also use a `for` loop to iterate directly over a sequence of values
- Python supports many different types of sequences, but thus far we only know about one: strings!
	- Recall strings are just a sequence of individual characters
- We can loop through a string to examine each individual character
- Example looping through to count occurances of a given letter:

	```python
	def count_letters(letter, string):
		count = 0
		for character in string:
			if character == letter:
				count += 1
		return count
	```

## Announcements
- Homework 1 posted!
	- Pdf on the main webpage.
	- Link in pdf to add repository, then download to edit on your own system!
	- Due at midnight next Friday
	- Make sure to change the appropriate spot in the README file to DONE when you are finished so I know it is ready to grade!
		- Otherwise it will count against your late days!
- Polling:
	- [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)
- The early chapters in this class cover a lot of material. I really do recommend you be following along in the book, as it can flesh many of these concepts out more than we can in limited class time.
- Lab was a bit much on Wednesday, I made sure today's is more succinct. Sorry!

## Review Question
What is the final printed value of `A` in the code below?
```idle
>>> A = 10
>>> B = 4
>>> C = A * B
>>> A -= B
>>> A, B, C = C, A, B
>>> print(A)
??
```
:::{.poll}
#. 4
#. 10
#. 30
#. 40

## Insert Comment Here
- Frequently might want to make a note or comment in your code
	- Reminders to _yourself_ or future coders
	- Do **not** want the computer to try to do anything with it
- Two forms of comments
	- `# line comments` prefaced with a `#` symbols
		- Commonly used to provide a quick explanation of what a line does
	- `"""block comments"""` bracketed with triple quotes
		- Commonly used to describe what entire scripts or functions do

## String Theory
- Would be nice to work with more interesting data than just numbers
- Everything internally is represented as sequences of binary numbers, but more useful to think abstractly about concepts initially
- First non-numeric data type to look at will be **strings**
	- Domain is all _sequences_ of characters
		- A single string is often comprised of multiple characters
	- Indicated in Python with pairs of quotes (single or double)

	```python
	"This is a great string!"
	'And this is also a string!'
	```

## String Functions
- Python has several built-in functions that are useful when working with strings

Function | Description
---|---
`len(s)` | Gets the number of characters in `s`
`str(x)` | Converts the value of `x` to a string
`int(s)` | Attempts to convert `s` to an integer
`float(s)` | Attempts to convert `s` to a float
`print(...)` | Prints all arguments separated by spaces
`input(prompt)` | Shows the user `prompt` and then reads in a typed string


## Stringy Operations
- Initially we will focus just on _concatenating_ strings, or combining them end to end
	- Many more operations we'll look at later in Ch 6
- Concatenate in Python using the `+` operator:

	```idle
	>>> print("ABC" + "DEF")
	ABCDEF
	```
- `+` with numbers gets you addition, `+` with strings gets you concatenation
- If you have mixed types and want concatenation, need to convert all to strings

	```idle
	>>> print("Catch" + str(-22))
	Catch-22
	```

## Running a Program
- You can run Python programs directly from the command line
	- Many development environments do this for you when you click "Run"
- Python programs specify what part of the code is supposed to be run when this happens using a few special lines at the end of the program

	```python
	if __name__ == '__main__':
		function_to_run()
	```
	- `function_to_run` is the name of whatever function you want to run when the program is run
- Patterns of this sort are commonly called _boilerplate_
	- Less important to fully understand all the pieces of it now
	- Is important to understand what it is doing and how to implement it correctly

## An adding program

``` {.python style="max-height: 100%"}
# File: AddTwoIntegers.py

"""
This program adds two integers entered by the user.
"""

def add_two_integers():
	print("This program adds two integers.")
	n1 = int(input("Enter n1? "))
	n2 = int(input("Enter n2? "))
	total = n1 + n2
	print("The sum is", total)

# Startup boilerplate
if __name__ == '__main__':
	add_two_integers()
```

## Making Choices
::::cols
:::col
- So far, everything we've done proceeds in a straight line
	- Simple, but inherently limited (and a bit boring)
	- Not much we can do with it beyond basic calculations
- Want to transition now to talk about how we can create branching programs

	\draw[myline, Blue] (0,0) -- +(0,6);

## Statement Types
- Statements in Python fall into two main types:
	- Simple Statements
		- Typically variable assignments or function calls
	- Control Statements
		- _Conditional statements_ that specify some kind of test
		- _Iterative statements_ that specify some kind of repetition
		- Begin with a _header line_ that defines how the statement affects program flow.
		- Takes control over a block of statements, called the _body_, indented with respect to the header

## Boolean Expressions
- Python defines two types of operators that work with Boolean data: _relational operators_ and _logical operators_
- Relational operators compare values of other types and produce a `True`/`False` result:

	---- ----------------- - - - ---- --------------------
	`==` Equals                  `!=` Not equals
	 `<` Less than               `<=` Less than or equal too
	 `>` Greater than            `>=` Greater than or equal to
	---- ----------------- - - - ---- --------------------
- Be careful! `==` _compares_ two booleans. A single `=` _assigns_ a variable. The odds are high you'll use one when you meant the other at least once this semester!

## The Vulcan Way
- Logical operators act on Boolean pairings

	Operator | Description
	---|---
	`A and B` | True if both terms True, False otherwise
	`A or B` | True if _any_ term is True, False otherwise
	`not A` | True if A False, False if A True (opposite)

::: incremental
- Order of operations follows parentheses and then proceeds left to right
- Careful that `or` is still `True` if both options are `True` which is a little different than common English use
- Similarly, careful with combining `not` with `and` and `or`
	- "Not A or B" in common English is not the same as `not A or B`
:::

## Shorting the Circuit
- Python evaluates _and_ and _or_ operators using a strategy called _short-circuit mode_
- Only evaluates the right operand if it actually needs to
	- Example: if `n=0`, then the `x % n == 0` is never actually checked in the statement

		```python
		n != 0 and x % n == 0
		```

		since `n != 0` already is `False` and `False and ` _anything_ is always `False`
- Can use short-circuit to prevent errors: the above `x % n == 0` statement would have erred out if `n=0`


## The Conditional
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
	[ 
	block/.style={rounded corners, draw, very thick, fill=Orange, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, font=\large\bf, text=black},
	choice/.style={rounded corners, draw, very thick, fill=Blue, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, font=\large\bf, diamond, text=black}
	]
	\draw[line width=3pt, Purple] (2.5,-3) rectangle (9,3);

	\node[block](c1) at (0,0) {Code};
	\node[choice, align=center](t) at (4,0) {Boolean\\Test};
	\node[block, fill=Teal](true) at (6,2) {True Block};
	\node[block, fill=Red](false) at (6,-2) {False Block};
	\node[block](c2) at (11,0) {Code};

	\draw[ultra thick, -latex, white] (c1.east) -- (t.west);
	\draw[ultra thick, -latex, Teal] (t.north) |- (true.west);
	\draw[ultra thick, -latex, Red] (t.south) |- (false.west);
	\draw[ultra thick, -latex, white] (true.east) -| ($(c2.west)-(2,0)$) -- (c2.west);
	\draw[ultra thick, -latex, white] (false.east) -| ($(c2.west)-(2,0)$) -- (c2.west);
\end{tikzpicture}

## Conditional Syntax
In Python, the basic conditional looks like:
```python
if boolean_expression:
	# True block of code
	# Code to run if the test evaluates to True
else:
	# False block of code
	# Code to run if the test evaluates to False
```

- Things to note
	- A colon `:` ends the header and `else` lines (before each indent block)
	- You do not need an `else` portion if your desired false block is empty
	- The `boolean_expression` just has to be something that evaluates to either `True` or `False`

## Controlling Functions
 - The body of a function can contain statements of any type, including control statements
 - Example:
 	
	```python
	def max(x, y):
		if x > y:
			return x
		else:
			return y
	```
- `return` statements can be used anywhere and may appear more than once
	- The function terminates as soon as it hits a `return` statement though!

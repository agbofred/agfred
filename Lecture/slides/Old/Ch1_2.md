- CS Tea
	- Thursdays in Ford 2nd floor, 11:30 - 12:30
	- Historically pizza available, but probably not this semester


## Order of Operations
- Basic order of operations applies just like in math!
- Operations in parentheses done first
- Without parentheses, order of operations proceeds as:
	- `**` (exponents)
	- `-n` (negative numbers)
	- `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, executed from left to right
	- `+` and `-`, executed from left to right


## Review Question
What is the value of the below expression?

``` {.python}
1 * 2 * 3 + (4 + 5) % 6 + (7 * 8) // 9
```
:::{.poll}
#. 15
#. 18.22
#. 42
#. 83
:::


## Tis Variable {data-auto-animate=}
- The simplest terms that appear in expressions are constant literals and variables
- A _variable_ is a placeholder for a value that can be updated as the program progresses
- Most easily envisioned as a named box capable of storing a value
		\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=20%, alt='Will this work?, data-id=box'
			\node[draw, very thick, Teal, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1.5cm, font=\LARGE](box) {42};
			\node[Teal, anchor=south west, inner sep=0pt, yshift=1mm] at (box.north west) {Name};
		\end{tikzpicture}
- Each variable has the following attributes:
	- A _name_: which enables you to tell variables apart
	- A _value_: which represents the current contents of the variable
- A variable's name is fixed, but the value can change whenever you _assign_ a new value to the variable

## Making Assignments
- You create a variable by assigning it a value using an _assignment statement_:
```python
variable = expression
```
- First computes the value of the righthand side and then assigns to the left
	- The same variable can appear on both sides of the equals!
	```python
	total = total + value
	```
- When you assign a new value to a variable, the old value is lost
```idle
>>> A = 10
>>> print(A)
10
>>> A = A + 5
>>> print(A)
15
```

## The Power of Names 
::: incremental
- Names for variable, function, and classes are called _identifiers_
- Composed of letters, numbers and underscores, but **can not start with a number**
- A variety of different conventions to mark word boundaries:
	- _Snake case_ uses underscores: `this_is_amazing`
	- _Camel case_ uses uppercase: `thisIsAmazing`
- We will aim to follow the following conventions:
	- Variable and function names will use snake case
	- Constant variables will use all uppercase and underscores: `MAX_WIDTH`
	- Class names will use camel case and begin with a capital lettera
- Capitalization matters! `radius` and `Radius` are different variables!
- **Pick meaningful variable names!**
:::

## Shorthand and Multiple
- It is very common to want to adjust an existing variable
```python
balance = balance + deposit
```
- Python gives you a shorter expression to describe this relationship:
```python
balance += deposit
```
- You can do this with any operation (op) following the general form:
```python
variable op= expression
```
- You can name multiple variables at once by separating with commas

	```python
	A, B, C = 1, 2, 3
	``` 
	- All the expressions on the right are computed before being assigned to the left variables

## Understanding Check!
:::::{.cols}
::::{.col}
Given the short sequence of commands below, what would be the final value printed to the screen?
::::
::::{.col}

:::{.poll}
#. 24
#. 28
#. 32
#. 36

:::::

```{.idle}
>>> RATIO = 2
>>> side = 4
>>> perimeter = 2 * side + 2 * RATIO * side
>>> side += 2
>>> print(perimeter)
??
```

## What is your Function?
- A _function_ is a sequence of statements that have been collected together and given a name.
	- Typically takes some input or information in the form of _arguments_, and then returns a result or output 
- Operates similar to the idea of functions in mathematics, hence the name
<br><br>

::::{.cols}
:::{.col}

:::::{.block name="Math Function"}
Take a general function:
$$f(x) = x^2 -5 $$
We input values of $x$ and get out some new value.
$$f(0) = -5,\quad f(2) = -1$$

:::{.col}

:::::{.block name="Python Function"}
```python
def f(x):
	return x ** 2 - 5
```

## Built-ins
- All modern languages include a collection of pre-defined functions for convenience
- In Python, common build-in functions that operate on numbers include:

Function | Description
--- | ---
`abs(x)` | The absolute value of x
`max(x,y,...)` | The largest of all the arguments
`min(x,y,...)` | The smallest of all the arguments
`round(x)` | The value of x rounded to the nearest integer
`int(x)` | The value of x truncated to an integer
`float(x)` | The value of x as a decimal

## Visiting the library(ies)
- A huge strength of Python is that it offers a very large number of code collections called _libraries_
	- Can save you the effort from writing that code yourself!
- Requires you to _import_ that library, which can take several different forms
	- Most common is to use `import` to grab everything in a library

		```python
		import math
		```
		- You must then access any function in that library using its _fully qualified name_, which includes the library name (`var = math.sqrt(4)`)
	- Can also use `from ... import` to grab specific functions from the library

		```python
		from math import sqrt
		```
		- You do not need to use the library name then when you call it (`var = sqrt(4)`)


## Useful `math` definitions

Code | Description
--- | ---
`math.pi` | The mathematical constant $\pi$
`math.e` | The mathematical constant $e$
`math.sqrt(x)` | The square root of x
`math.log(x)` | The natural logarithm of x
`math.log10(x)` | The base 10 logarithm of x
`math.sin(x)` | The sine of x in radians
`math.cos(x)` | The cosine of x in radians
`math.asin(x)` | The arcsin of x
`math.degrees(x)` | Converts from radians to degrees
`math.radians(x)` | Converts from degrees to radians


## Writing your own functions
- The general form of a function definition looks like:

	``` {.no-highlight}
	def name(parameter list):
		statements in function body
	```
	- `name` is your chosen name for the function
	- `parameter list`{.no-highlight} is the list of variable names that will hold each argument value
- You can return or output a value from the function by including a return statement

	```python
	return expression
	```
	- `expression` is the value you want to return or output
	- If no `return` statement is including, Python will by default return `None`


## Simple function examples
- Convert Fahrenheit temperatures to their Celsius equivalent

	```python
	def f_to_c(f):
		return 5 / 9 * (f - 32)
	```
	- Using the function:

		```python
		print(f_to_c(45))
		```
- Computes the volume of a cylinder of height `h` and radius `r`

	```python
	def cylinder_volume(r, h):
		return math.pi * r**2 * h
	```
	- Using the function:

		```python
		print(cylinder_volume(2,10))
		```


## Running a Program
- You can run Python programs directly from the command line
	- Many development environments do this for you when you click "Run"
- Python programs specify what part of the code is supposed to be run when this happens using a few special lines at the end of the program

	```python
	if __name__ == '__main__':
		function_to_run()
	```
	- `function_to_run` is the name of whatever function you want to run when the program is run
- Patterns of this sort are commonly called _boilerplate_
	- Less important to fully understand all the pieces of it now
	- Is important to understand what it is doing and how to implement it correctly

## An adding program

``` {.python style="max-height: 100%"}
# File: AddTwoIntegers.py

"""
This program adds two integers entered by the user.
"""

def add_two_integers():
	print("This program adds two integers.")
	n1 = int(input("Enter n1? "))
	n2 = int(input("Enter n2? "))
	total = n1 + n2
	print("The sum is", total)

# Startup boilerplate
if __name__ == '__main__':
	add_two_integers()
```

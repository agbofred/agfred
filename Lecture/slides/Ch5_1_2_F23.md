## Announcements
- Feedback on PS3 is completed.
- Midterm exam 1 is Friday at **9:10 am - 10:10 am** in this hall
- Come with a computer for the exam
- We shall test-run the exam on Canvas in the last 10 minutes of today's class
- Practice exam questions 2 will be released on Canvas after the class
- Ch 6 of the text will begin  week 
- I am going over **Functions** today to clarify last review question & explanations
    - also to emphasize program tracing

## Wordle Tidbits
- Two useful ideas for Wordle:
	- You can check if an individual element is in a particular sequence of elements using the `in` keyword
	  
	  ```python
	  "1" in "12345"
	  ```
	  - Always returns a boolean (True/False)
	- You can change the case of all letters in a string using `upper()` or `lower()` methods
	  
	  ```python
	  lowered = "ABCDEF".lower()
	  uppered = "abcDEF".upper()
	  ```
	  - The method returns a **new** string, so make sure you assign it to something

## Mid-term test
- Test will take place during the class time **9:10 - 10:10 0n Friday**.
- Those with accommodations should already contact the testing center and cc me.
- Practice questions are posted on this week's module
- Basic things to keep in mind:
	- The test contain detailed information to guide on what to expect. ***Read it carefully***
	- The exam is partially open, and thus you are free to utilize:
		- The text
		- Your notes
		- Class slides
		- Any past work you have done as part of sections, problem sets, or projects, provided it has been uploaded, and you access it through GitHub.

## Mid-term test 		
- You are allowed to use a computer for ease of typing and accessing the above resources, 
- You are **prohibited** from accessing and using any editor or terminal to run your code. 
	- Visual Studio Code or any similar editor should **never** be open on your computer during this exam. 
- Additionally, you are **prohibited** from accessing outside internet resources beyond the webpages described above.

## Positional VS Keyward arguments
- A function defined with positional arguments assigns each argument to its corresponding parameter when it's called 
```python
>>> def func( first, second, third ):
        print( first, second, third )
>>> func(1,2,3)
1 2 3
>>> func(2,6,4)
2 6 4
```
- First argument to first parameter, second to second parameter, etc

## Keyword arguments
- Arguments may also be specified by a keyword, in which the caller precedes the argument with a parameter name and equals sign

- Always stores the argument value in the specified parameter
```python
>>> def func( first, second, third ):
        print( first, second, third )
>>> func(third=4, first=2, second=6)
2 6 4
```
- **Keyword arguments can appear in any order**
- We can mix positional and keyword arguments when calling a function, butâ€¦
- All keyword arguments must come after any positional arguments!

## Default parameters
- When defining a function, arguments could be assigned default value
```python

def num_dif(w=30, h=55):
    ans = w-h
    return ans
num_dif(h=3, w=33) # keyword parameters mapped to override the default argument

```
- This function define **w = 30** and **h = 55** as their default values 
- This example calls the function with keyword parameter but different values
- Although the parameter arrangement changed, the keyword fashion assigns values based on their  parameter names

## Default Arguments
- Here is an example we saw in last class

```python
def printArea(width = 1, height = 2):
    area = width * height
    print("width:", width, "\theight:", height, "\tarea:", area)

printArea() # Default arguments width = 1 and height = 2
printArea(4, 2.5) # Positional arguments width = 4 and height = 2.5
printArea(height = 5, width = 3) # Keyword arguments width 
printArea(width = 1.2) # Default height = 2
printArea(height = 6.2) # Default widht = 1
```

## Review Question! {data-notes="Answer is 27"}

::::::cols
::::col
What would be the printed value of z at the end of the code to the right?

:::{.poll}
#. 19
#. 25
#. 27
#. None of the above
:::

::::

::::col
```python
def f(x,y=0):
	z = (x + 3) ** 2
	return y + z

x = 1
z = x + f(y=x,x=2)
print(z)

```

## Walk through vegas
- Consider the code to below. When the final value of ```x``` and ```z``` are printed, what will their value be?
```python
def Vegas(x):
    y = 2
    for i in range(5):
        x += y
    return x

x = 3
z = Vegas(x)
print('z =', z)
print('x =', x)
```

## Mystery word
- Let us walk through this program and unravel what will be printed when the program complete execution.

```python
def mystery (x):
    def enigma (s, t):
        t -= 2
    return s [::6] + s[t]
y = len(x)
z = x[1 - y]
z += enigma (x, y)
z += enigma (x, y - 2)
print(z)

if __name__ == '__main__ ':
    print( mystery ("abcdefgh"))



```

## Graphic function with default color
- You can return any type of variable from a function, including GObject graphical objects
- Can be useful to write simple functions that bundle together common tasks
    - For instance, to create a filled circle centered at some location:

```python
def make_filled_circ(x_cent, y_cent, radius, color='black'):
    circle = GOval(x_cent-radius, y_cent-radius, 2*radius, 2*radius)
    circle.set_color(color)
    circle.set_filled(True)
    return circle

```

## Summary of a Function Call 

:::{.incremental style='font-size:.8em'}
#. Evaluate the arguments in the context of the caller
#. Reserve space for the function in a new stack frame
#. Copy each positional argument to the corresponding parameter variable
#. Copy each keyword argument to the parameter with that name
#. For parameters with default values, if not already assigned, assign those values
#. Evaluate statements in the function body, using current stack frame to look up values of local variables
#. On encountering a `return`, compute the return value and substitute that value in place of the function call
#. Remove the stack frame
#. Return to the caller, continuing from just after the function call
:::


## Name Resolution and Scope
- When Python encounters a variable name in a program, it looks for where the variable was defined in an expanding search:
	1. **Local** - The local context is all the variables defined within the current function. This includes variables appearing as a parameter!
	2. **Enclosing** - The enclosing context consists of the names defined in a function enclosing the current one.
	3. **Global** - The global context consists of names defined outside of any function or imported into the current module.
	4. **Built-in** - The last place Python looks is in the names of any built-in functions, like `abs`, `str`, `print`, etc.
- The part of a program in which a name is defined in called its _scope_

## Scoping Example
```{.python data-line-numbers="" style='max-height:900px'}
def func1(x,y):
	return z + func2(x,y)

def func2(x,y):
	def func3(x):
		return (y + x) ** 2

	z = x - func3(y)
	return z - y

z = 1
print(func1(2,z))
```

## Maps and Dictionaries
- A common form of information associates pairs of data values
	- Commonly called a _map_ in computer science
	- Python calls such a structure a _dictionary_
- A dictionary associates two different values:
	- A simple value called the _key_, which is often a string but doesn't need to be
	- A larger and more complex object called the _value_
- This idea of associating pairs of values is exhibited all over in the real world
	- Actual dictionaries! The words are the keys, the definitions the values.
	- Web addresses! Keys are the urls, the values are the webpage contents.

## Creating Dictionaries
- Python dictionaries use squiggly brackets `{}` to bracket their contents
- Can create an empty dictionary by providing no key-value pairs:
  ```python
  empty_dict = {}
  ```
- If creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
	- Keys are separated from values with a colon `:`
	- Pairs are separated by a comma `,`
  ```python
  generic_dict = {'Bob': 21, 0: False, 13: 'Thirteen'}
  ```

## Maps and Dictionaries
- A common form of information associates pairs of data values
	- Commonly called a _map_ in computer science
	- Python calls such a structure a _dictionary_
- A dictionary associates two different values:
	- A simple value called the _key_, which is often a string but doesn't need to be
	- A larger and more complex object called the _value_
- This idea of associating pairs of values is exhibited all over in the real world
	- Actual dictionaries! The words are the keys, the definitions the values.
	- Web addresses! Keys are the urls, the values are the webpage contents.

## Creating Dictionaries
- Python dictionaries use squiggly brackets `{}` to enclose their contents
- Can create an empty dictionary by providing no key-value pairs:
  ```python
  empty_dict = {}
  ```
- If creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
	- Keys are separated from values with a colon `:`
	- Pairs are separated by a comma `,`
  ```python
  generic_dict = {'Bob': 21, 0: False, 13: 'Thirteen'}
  ```

## Keys and Values
- The value of a key-value pair can be **any** Python object, mutable or immutable
	- This include other dictionaries!
- The key is more restricted:
	- Must be immutable
		- So dictionaries or lists can **not** work as a key
		- Tuples can though!
	- Must be unique per dictionary

::::::cols
::::col
:::{.block name=Viable}
```python
A = {True: 'Seth', False: 'Jesse'}
B = {'Jill': 13, 'Jack': 12}
C = {(1,2): {'x': 1}}
```
:::

::::col
:::{.block name=Illegal style='border-color:var(--red)'}
```python
#X = {{'x': 1, 'y': 2}: 'Shark'}
Y = {[1,3,5]: 'Odd'}
Z = {'A': 13, 'B': 24, 'A': 15}
```

## Selection
- The fundamental operation on dictionaries is selection, which is still indicated with square brackets: `[]`
- Dictionaries though are **unordered**, so it is not a numeric index that goes inside the `[ ]`
- You instead use the key directly to select corresponding values:
  ```python-repl
  >>> A = {'Jack': 12, 'Jill': 13}['Jack']
  >>> print(A)
  13
  >>> B = {True: 13, 0: 'Why?'}[0]
  >>> print(B)
  Why?
  ```

## Losing your keys
- If you attempt to index out a key that doesn't exist:
  ```{.python .badcode}
  A = {'Jack': 12, 'Jill': 13}
  print(A['Jil'])
  ```
  you will get an error!
- If in doubt, check for the presence of a key with the `in` operator:
  ```python
  if 'Jil' in A:
	  print(A['Jil'])
  ```

## Rewriting the Dictionary
- Dictionaries are _mutable_!
	- We can add new key-value pairs
	- We can change the value of corresponding keys
```python-repl
>>> d = {}
>>> d['A'] = 10
>>> d['B'] = 12
>>> print(d)
{'A':10, 'B':12}
>>> d['A'] = d['B']
>>> print(d)
{'A':12, 'B':12}
```



## Grade Sheet Example
- Suppose we had a file of student ids and accompanying scores that we wanted to read into a dictionary and then access.
  ```{.python style='max-height:700px; font-size:.8em; line-heigh:2em;'}
  def read_to_dict(filename):
      dictionary = {}
      with open(filename) as f:
          for line in f:
              ID, score = line.strip().split(',')
              dictionary[ID] = score
      return dictionary
  
  def get_student_score():
      scores = read_to_dict('SampleGrades.txt')
      done = False
      while not done:
          student_id = input('Enter a student id number: ')
          if student_id == "":
              done = True
          else:
              if student_id in scores:
                  print(f"Student got a {scores[student_id]}.")
              else:
                  print(f"Student id {student_id} was not found in classlist")
  ```

## Understanding Check {data-notes="Solution: [125,167,204]"}
What is the printed value of the below code?
```python
A = [
	{'name': 'Jill',  'weight':125, 'height':62},
	{'name': 'Sam',   'height':68},
	{'name': 'Bobby', 'height':72},
]
A.append({'weight':204, 'height':70, 'name':'Jim'})
B= A[1]
B['weight'] = 167
print([d['weight'] for d in A if 'weight' in d])
```


<div class='cols'>
<div class='col poll'>
<ol>
	<li> `[100,204]`</li>
	<li>`[156,173,204]`</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class='col poll'>
<ol style='counter-reset: li 2'>
	<li> `[100,167,173,204]` </li>
	<li>`[125,167,204]` </li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>


## Iterating through a Dictionary
- Frequently we might want to iterate through a dictionary, checking either its values or its keys
- Python supports iteration with the `for` statement, which has the form of:
  ```python
  for key in dictionary:
  	  value = dictionary[key]
  	  code to work with that key and value
  ```
- You can also use the `.items` method to grab both key and values together:
	- Returns a tuple with both the key and corresponding pair
  ```python
  for key, value in dictionary.items():
  	  code to work with that key and value
  ```

## Finding Students by grade
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
def get_students_with_score():
    scores = read_to_dict('SampleGrades.txt')
    done = False
    while not done:
        des_grade = input('Enter a letter grade: ')
        if des_grade == "":
            done = True
        else:
            for st_id, grade in scores.items():
                if grade == des_grade.strip().upper():
                    print(f"{st_id} got a {grade}")
```


## Common Dictionary Methods

Method call | Description
---|-----
`len(dict)`{.python} | Returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary
`dict.get(key, value)`{.python} | Returns the value associated with the `key` in the dictionary. If the key is not found, returns the specified value, which is `None` by default
`dict.pop(key)`{.python} | Removes the key-value pair corresponding to `key` and returns the associated value. Will raise an error if the key is not found.
`dict.clear()`{.python} | Removes all key-value pairs from the dictionary, leaving it empty.
`dict.items()`{.python} | Returns an iterable object that cycles through the successive tuples consisting of a key-value pair.


## Dictionary Records
- While most commonly used to indicate mappings, dictionaries have seen increased use of late as structures to store records
- Looks surprisingly close to our original template of:
  ```python
  boss = {
	  'name': 'Scrooge',
	  'title': 'founder',
	  'salary': 1000
	  }
  ```
- Allows easy access of attributes without worrying about ordering
  ```python
  print(boss['name'])
  ```

## Mathematical Sets
- A _set_ is an unordered collection of **distinct** values.
	- **digits** =  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
	- **evens** =  0, 2, 4, 6, 8 
	- **odds** =  1, 3, 5, 7, 9 
	- **primes** =  2, 3, 5, 7 
	- **squares** =  0, 1, 4, 9 
	- **primary** =  red, green, blue 
	- **$\mathbf{R}$** =  x where x is a real number 
	- **$\mathbf{Z}$** =  x where x is an integer 
	- **$\mathbf{N}$** =  x where x is an integer >=0 
- The set with no elements is call the _empty set_ (∅)

## Pythonic Sets
- Enclosed within squiggly brackets
- No key-value pairs, just single values separated by commas
```python
digits = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
squares = { 0, 1, 4, 9 }
primary = { "red", "green", "blue" }
```
- Set elements must be immutable
- Sets themselves are generally mutable
- Can **not** create an empty set just using `{ }`!
	- Python assumes this to be an empty dictionary!
	- Must instead use `set()`.

## Set Operations
- The fundamental set operation is _membership_ (∈)
	- 3 ∈ **primes**
	- 3 ∉ **evens**
	- red ∈ **primary**
	- -1 ∉ **N**
- The _union_ of the sets $A$ and $B$ ($A \cup B$) consists of all elements in either $A$ or $B$ or both.
- The _intersection_ of the sets $A$ and $B$ ($A \cap B$) consists of all elements in both $A$ and $B$.
- The _set difference_ of $A$ and $B$ ($A - B$) consists of all elements in $A$ but not in $B$.
- The _symmetric set difference_ of $A$ and $B$ ($A\triangle B$) consists of all elements in $A$ or $B$ but not in both.

## Python Implementations
- Python's built-in implementation of sets supports all these same operations
- Can either use appropriately named methods on sets or operators between sets
- Membership
	`3 in primes`{.inlinecode}

:::{.cols}

- Union:

<!--
## Losing the Keys
- Dictionaries are unordered, all the lookup information comes from the key
- When you ask for an value corresponding to a certain key, the computer needs to search the dictionary for a matching key
- There are several possible approaches to doing this, which we'll talk a bit more about later in the semester
	- Most strategies take longer the larger the dictionary is (which probably makes sense)
	- One strategy though, called _hashing_, implements a function on the space of possible keys, which ends up telling the implementation exactly where to look for the matching item. The result being that this strategy does _not_ take more time for a larger dictionary!

- Possible implementations:
	- _Linear search_: This implementation keeps track of the name-value pairs in an array, and just loops through the array to find or place new keys in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time
	- _Binary search_: This implementation keeps track of the name-value pairs in an array but keeps them sorted by some method. Then uses binary search to find or place new keys in $\mathcal{O}{\log N}$ time


## Hashing
- Can seem surprising or magical that we could have a method that takes a constant amount of time to look up a value independent of the length of the map or dictionary!
- Envision finding a word in a dictionary
	- Most have markings along the edge where each section of letters starts, so you know where to start looking
- The most common map and dictionary implementations use a strategy called _hashing_, which is conceptually similar to using the section markings on a dictionary.
	- Critical idea is that can you massively improve performance if you use the key itself to help you figure out where to look

## Hash Codes, not Browns
- Hash codes must follow a set of guidelines (or a code of conduct):
	#. The hash code must be relatively easy to compute
	#. The hash code for a particular object must always be the same for a given Python session
	#. If two objects are identical, they must have the same hash code
	#. The hash codes must be distributed as randomly/evenly as possible over the space of possible keys
- Python has a built-in function called `hash` that takes an object and returns an integer, which is called the _hash code_ for that object
- Maps using the hashing algorithm use the hash code for a key as a starting point to help find the associated value.


## Bucket Hashing
- One common strategy is to choose a certain number of _buckets_ to make up an array, where each object's hash will place it into a particular bucket
	- Would mean that, having checked a key's hash, you'd know which bucket to look in!
- In practice, the number of buckets is smaller than the number of hash codes, so you need a way to decide on what hash code corresponds to which bucket.
	- Typically done with a remainder operation along the lines of
	```python
	bucket = abs(hash(key)) % num_buckets
	```
- Some buckets will still end up with multiple key-value pairs. These are called _collisions_ and lower the efficiency of the algorithm.
- Since hash codes are spread around equally, each bucket in theory would end up with similar numbers of key-value pairs


## Bucket Hashing Example 
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:0.8em;'}
class Dictionary:
    NBUCKETS = 10

    def __init__(self):
        self.buckets = [ [] for _ in range(Dictionary.NBUCKETS)]

    def get(self, key):
        H = hash(key)
        bucket_id = abs(H) % Dictionary.NBUCKETS
        for pair in self.buckets[bucket_id]:
            if pair[0] == key:
                return pair[1]
        return None

    def put(self, key, value):
        H = hash(key)
        bucket_id = abs(H) % Dictionary.NBUCKETS
        bucket = self.buckets[bucket_id]
        for i in range(len(bucket)):
			bkey, bvalue = bucket[i]
            if bkey == key:
                bucket[i] = (key, value)
                return
        bucket.append((key,value))

    def __repr__(self):
        return repr(self.buckets)
```

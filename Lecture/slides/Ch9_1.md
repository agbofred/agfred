## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: D[1][2]"}
After running the below code, how would you access the `"ninja"` element in list `D`?
```python
A = ['pirate', 'ninja']
B = ['samurai'] + A
C = [B, ['ship', 'rope', 'horse']]
D = C[::-1]
```

## Debugging

- Everyone makes mistakes when writing code
- A core skill then is in efficiently finding the bugs that you introduce
- We'll spend the first part of today looking at some good practices
	- As always though, practice makes perfect
:::

## Strategy #1
:::quip
Concentrate on what your program IS doing, instead of what it SHOULD be doing.
:::

- It is impossible to find code that is missing
- Instead focus on determining _what_ your program is doing, or _why_ it is behaving a certain way
- Only once you understand what it is currently doing can you entertain thinking about how to change it productively


## Strategy #2
:::quip
Let Python help you: print or log the state of different variables.
:::

- Many errors are caused by you expecting a variable to have some content that it doesn't have
- Get Python to help you by adding print statements to print those variables out
- Add print statements in blocks of code that you aren't sure are being accessed to see if you see a message


## Strategy #3
:::quip
Stop and read. The documentation. The error messages.
:::

## Parsing Error Messages
- Start at the bottom! That is where the general type of error and a short description will show up.
- Want to know where it happened? Look one line up from that.
	- Will show a copy of the line where the error occurred
	- One line up from that will include the line number
- Want nicer error messages?
	- The `rich` library offers some very pretty error messages: install with `pip install rich`
	- At the top of your code, then include:
	
	  ```python
	  from rich.traceback import install
	  install(show_locals=True)
	  ```

## Strategy #4
:::quip
Use PythonTutor or a debugger to track EXACTLY what is happening in your program.

## Strategy #5
:::quip
Don't make random changes to your code in the hopes that it will miraculously start working.
:::

- Making random changes is easy, fast, and doesn't require a lot of thought
- Unfortunately it is, at best, a wildly inefficient method of debugging, and at worst, actively detrimental
- If you don't know _what_ you need to fix yet, you either haven't:
	- Defined what you are attempting to do clearly enough, or
	- Understood / tracked your program well enough to know what it is currently doing


## Strategy #6
:::quip
Test your code as you go! Either manually or automatically.
:::

- Know that _everyone_ makes mistakes. The longer you go without testing that something in your program works, the harder it is to find where the mistake eventually is.
- Write code that you test in small pieces as you go
	- Decomposition into smaller functions is great for this: test each function individually as you go
	- In the projects we have tried to set up Milestones for this exact same purpose


## Strategy #7
:::quip
Talk it out.
:::

- Explaining things verbally, in plain English, uncovers a shocking amount of misconceptions or mistakes
- Find someone to talk at about your programming issues
	- It isn't even important that they understand how to code, or even can talk back to you (though that might help in some cases)
	- [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is where a software developer explains an issue out loud to an inanimate rubber duck


## An Object's Purpose
- Python uses the concepts of objects and classes to achieve at least three different goals:
	- __Aggregation__. Objects make it possible to represent collections of independent data as a single unit. Such collections are traditionally called _records_.
	- __Encapsulation__. Classes make it possible to store data together with the operations that manipulate that data.
		- In Python the data values are called _attributes_ and the operations are called _methods_
	- __Inheritance__. Class hierarchies make it possible for a class that shares some attributes and methods with a previously defined class to _inherit_ those definitions without rewriting them all
- We'll introduce many of these concepts in this course, but for more exposure and practice you'll want to take CS 152 (Data Structures)


## Old Records
- Records are a very old idea, dating back to the 19th century BCE
- Frequently pressed into clay
- In 2017, researchers established that the below tablet records Pythagorean triples!

## Recording Dickens
- Suppose we had some records from the two-employee firm Scrooge and Marley
- Each contains the employee name, their title, and their salary

\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=70%
[record/.style={draw, minimum width=4cm, font=\tt},
lab/.style={font=\tt\small, anchor=south west},
]
\node[record, MGreen](n) at (0,0) {"Ebenezer Scrooge"};
\node[lab, MGreen](nl) at (n.north west) {name};
\node[record, MGreen, below=.75cm of n](t){"founder"};
\node[lab, MGreen] at (t.north west) {title};
\node[record, MGreen, below=.75cm of t](s) {1000};
\node[lab, MGreen] at (s.north west) {salary};
\node[fit=(nl)(s), draw, very thick, MGreen] {};

\node[record, MBlue](n) at (5,0) {"Bob Cratchit"};
\node[lab, MBlue](nl) at (n.north west) {name};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of n](t) {"clerk"};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (t.north west) {title};
\node[record, MBlue, below=.75cm of t](s) {15};
\node[lab, MBlue] at (s.north west) {salary};
\node[fit=(nl)(s), draw, very thick, MBlue] {};

\end{tikzpicture}

## Tuple Time
- In Python, simplest strategy for representing a record uses the built-in type _tuple_
	- An ordered, **immutable** sequence of values
- Feel similar to lists, except immutable, and used very differently
	- Think of tuples as more like records than lists
- Created by enclosing a collection of elements in parentheses
`employee = ("Bob Cratchit", "clerk", 15)`{.inlinecode}
- Ordered, so each element has a corresponding index

## Tuple Usage
- Can largely envision tuples as sitting between strings and lists
	- Immutable, like strings
	- Elements can be _anything_, like lists
- Common operations mimic that of strings
	- Can concatenate with addition
	- Can duplicate by multiplying by an integer
	- Can index and slice them
	- Can loop over them directly or via index
- A tuple of a single value **needs** a comma still in order to be a tuple


## Tuple Selection
- You can select or slice elements from a tuple just like you can with lists
	- Unfortunately, records are not usually ordered in a particular way. Rather, it is the name that is usually important
- If using tuples, you can make programs more readable by using a _destructuring assignment_, which breaks a tuple into named components:

`name, title, salary = employee`{.inlinecode .no-highlight}

- While modern versions of Python have such thing as a _named tuple_, we will not look at them here.
	- The more general strategy is to define a new class to better represent the objects in question

## Classes vs Objects
- When we introduced PGL early in the semester, we stressed the difference between types/classes and objects
	- A _class_ is the pattern or template that defines the structure and behavior of values with that particular type (the species of ant)
	- An _object_ is an individual value that belongs to a class (an individual ant)
		- A single class can be used to create any number of objects, each of which is said to be an _instance_ of that class
- PGL defines the `GRect` class.
	- In Breakout, you used that class to create **many** different rectangles, each of which was an instance of the `GRect` class

## Announcements
- Project 5 guide posted!
	- Section meetings this week will focus on common sticking points
	- I'm fine with you partnering with anyone from your small section or this class
		- Even if working alone, you will still need to form a "team" when accepting the assignment
		- Only join a team if you and that person have agreed to work together!
	- **Back things up to GitHub after finishing every Milestone!**
- Final
	- I will be posting final study materials and some old test at the end of the week so that you can start studying
	- Will be more weighted toward content from the latter half of the semester, but everything we've been doing this semester builds on earlier material
- Polling: [rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)


## Review Question!

::::cols
:::col
The two classes to the right mimic a bit of what might occur in the course of the Adventure Project. What python data type is `ANS`?

:::::poll
#. A String
#. An AdvObject
#. An AdvLocation
#. A List
:::::


:::
:::col


```{.python style='max-height:1000px; font-size:.6em;'}
class AdvObject:
	def __init__(self, name, loc):
		self.name = name
		self.loc = loc
	def get_loc(self):
		return self.loc

class AdvLocation:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
		self.stuff = []
	def store(self, item):
		self.stuff.append(item)
	def retrieve_top(self):
		return self.stuff.pop()

A = AdvObject("Hammer", "RA")
B = AdvObject("Torch", "RA")
RA = AdvLocation("Room A")
RA.store(A)
RA.store(B)
ANS = RA.retrieve_top().get_loc()
```

## Abstract Data Types
- Many object types have some aspect of storing information as their primary purpose
- Types that are instead defined largely by their behavior are called _abstract data types_ or _ADT_ s which have the following advantages
	- Simplicity. The internal representation is hidden from the client
	- Flexibility. If the internal representation needs to be changed by the programmer, they can do so without breaking outside compatibility
	- Security. Keeping the internal representation away from clients prevents clients from directly altering values that may cause the type to behave unexpectedly
- Want to start to focus on how we can bring all these ideas together to define our own abstract types


## Token ADT
- I find it helps to think of ADT's as a data type which helps to fulfill a particular objective or behavioral goal
	- They are little machines, packaged up inside a class
- Thinking back to our Pig Latin translation program:
	- `word_to_pig_latin` took a single word and translated into Pig Latin
	- To translate an entire sentence, we would need code to break the sentence up into individual words, which we could then pass into `word_to_pig_latin`
- The latter is an example of something that comes up often in computer science: breaking a larger thing into particular smaller chunks
	- These "chunks" can really be anything, so the more general term computer scientists use is a _token_

## A Token Scanner
- A class that plucked out individual tokens might be called a _token scanner_
- What would a client want from a token scanner?
	- A way to pass in the necessary input
	- A way to retrieve the next individual token
	- A way to know when there are no more tokens
	- Maybe a way to tailor what tokens are desired
- These requirements help inform what methods should be incorporated into a token scanner class!
	- Still need to determine what internal attributes or method might be needed

## Token Scanner Design
- Frequently, specific wants or objectives make for good methods to include in the token scanner
- Chapter 12 includes an example of a common implementation
- Exports 4 main methods:
	#. `scanner.set_input(str)`
	    - Sets the input of the token scanner to the specified string or input stream
	#. `scanner.next_token()`
		- Returns the next token from the stream, or `""` at the end
	#. `scanner.has_more_tokens`
		- Returns `True` if more tokens exist, `False` otherwise
	#. `scanner.ignore_whitespace()`
		- Customization option which tells the scanner to ignore whitespace characters

## Token Scanner Code
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:.6em; font-spacing:2em;' data-line-numbers='7-46|54-59|63-69|71-86|88-94|96-100|104-109'}
# File: tokenscanner.py

"""
This file implements a simple version of a token scanner class.
"""

# A token scanner is an abstract data type that divides a string into
# individual tokens, which are strings of consecutive characters that
# form logical units.  This simplified version recognizes two token types:
#
#   1. A string of consecutive letters and digits
#   2. A single character string
#
# To use this class, you must first create a TokenScanner instance by
# calling its constructor:
#
#     scanner = TokenScanner()
#
# The next step is to call the set_input method to specify the string
# from which tokens are read, as follows:
#
#     scanner.set_input(s)
#
# Once you have initialized the scanner, you can retrieve the next token
# by calling
#
#    token = scanner.next_token()
#
# To determine whether any tokens remain to be read, you can either
# call the predicate method scanner.has_more_tokens() or check to see
# whether next_token returns the empty string.
#
# The following code fragment serves as a pattern for processing each
# token in the string stored in the variable source:
#
#     scanner = TokenScanner(source)
#     while scanner.has_more_tokens():
#         token = scanner.next_token()
#         . . . code to process the token . . .
#
# By default, the TokenScanner class treats whitespace characters
# as operators and returns them as single-character tokens.  You
# can set the token scanner to ignore whitespace characters by
# making the following call:
#
#     scanner.ignore_whitespace()

class TokenScanner:

    """This class implements a simple token scanner."""

## Using `TokenScanner`
- Need to initialize the token scanner object
- Generally keep looping as long as there are still tokens
	- Each iteration, get the latest token and then do something with it


## Using `TokenScanner` in `PigLatin`
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
from tokenscanner import TokenScanner

def to_pig_latin(text):
	translation = ""
	scanner = TokenScanner()
	scanner.set_input(text)
	while scanner.has_more_tokens():
		token = scanner.next_token()
		if token.isalpha():
			token = word_to_pig_latin(token)
		translation += token
	return translation
```

## Searching for Efficiency
- Our last chapter is less about introducing new programming machinery and more about better understanding what we already have
- Hopefully you have realized by now that there can be **many** approaches to solving a problem computationally
	- So far, the first way you figure out has likely been the "best", in that it gets the job done.
	- Sometimes there is a different though in an approach that is technically correct and one that is practically correct.
	- How can we make informed choices about the algorithms we use?
- Want to look at algorithm efficiency in this chapter
- Will focus mainly on Searching and Sorting as our examples to better understand how an algorithm's efficiency can be quantified


## A Linear Search
- Suppose you needed to determine if a particular element was in a list, and didn't have any of the built-in methods available to you
- The easiest method (which many of you have indeed used!) is to just search through the list element by element and check it to see if it is the one you desire
	- This approach is called a _linear search_
- Easy to understand and implement:
  ```python
  def linear_search(quest, array):
  	  for i in range(len(array)):
  		  if array[i] == quest:
  			   return i
  	  return -1
  ```

## Searching for Area Codes
- To illustrate the efficiency of linear search, it can be helpful to work with a larger dataset
- We'll look here at searching through potential US area codes to find that of Salem: 503
- Linear search examines each value in order to find the matching value. 
	- As the arrays get larger, the number of steps required also grows
- As you watch linear search do its thing on the next slide, see if you can beat the computer at finding 503. 
	- What approach did you take?

## Linear Search in Action
<div class="fig-container" data-file="../images/d3/LinearSearch.html" data-style="width:100%; display:inline;" data-scroll="no"></div>


## How did you do?
- Frequently, many people can "beat the animation" in finding 503
- Approaches vary, but you may well have done something along the lines of:
	- Look at some number in the middle
	- Depending on how close it was to 503, jump ahead some in that direction and check again
- Requires some special conditions though, so let's try again

## Racing Linear Search Again

## Idea of a Binary Search
- If your data is ordered, then you might try a alternative search strategy
- Look at the center element in the array, it is either:
	- The value you want. Excellent! Return it.
	- A value larger than what you want. Throw away that value and everything bigger.
	- A value smaller than what you want. Throw away that value and everything smaller.
- Then you can repeat the process with the remaining elements until you find your value
- Since number of searched elements is divided by 2 each time, called a _binary search_


## Binary Search in Action
<div class="fig-container" data-file="../images/d3/BinarySearch.html" data-style="width:100%; display:inline;" data-scroll="no"></div>


## Implementing Binary Search
```{.python style="max-height:900px"}
def binary_search(target, array):
	lh = 0
	rh = len(array) - 1
	while lh <= rh:
		middle = (lh + rh) // 2
		if array[middle] == target:
			return middle
		elif array[middle] < target:
			lh = middle + 1
		else:
			rh = middle - 1
	return -1
```
